                    <p>Welcome! I'm Jeevith Kumar, a Civil Engineer and Master's student in Transportation and Highway Engineering at University of Southern California (USC). From childhood, I've been captivated by the intricate systems of highways, railways, and airways—this curiosity has driven my commitment to designing transportation solutions that not only enhance mobility but also create sustainable, connected communities across the globe.</p>
                    <p>I've had the privilege of contributing to transformative projects like the ₹3,500 crore Mysuru-Bengaluru Express Highway, where I played a key role in the six-lane expansion of NH-275, strengthening India's transportation backbone. My experience in rural road construction further expanded my skillset, focusing on road quality, drainage, and infrastructure resilience to bridge urban and rural communities.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my journey, I've honed my skills in cutting-edge tools and technologies, driving innovative transportation solutions across various projects. My work reflects a deep commitment to shaping the future of transportation with sustainable and impactful design practices.</p>
                    <p>Aviation, roads, and railways are at the core of my passion, and I am driven to advance the systems that connect the world. Imagine a future where transportation is intelligent, cities thrive, and connectivity knows no bounds—join me on this journey of innovation and progress. Envision a world where your commute is effortless, cities breathe easier, and infrastructure adapts to our ever-changing needs. This is the future I am building—one innovative project at a time.</p>
